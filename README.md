## Self-Assessment

The role I played within the team was strongly based towards the visualization aspect
of the project. I specifically designed 4/5 graphs in Tableau. I did this initially
by taking Adam's data pulled from Yahoo Finance and headcount data from Liberated Stock trader
and uploaded to Tableau. I used area graphs for gross profit per employee and net income per 
employee and added a detail table below to demonstrate the qty of companies within each sector 
that were fully remote below. The other two graphs were side by side bar graphs that targeted
Operating Income per Employee and Operating Expense per Employee. Ultimately all four graphs
helped demonstrate that although covid affected revenue in 2020 the revenues went back to 
the average meanwhile remote work has lingered which demonstrates that revenue has not been impacted
by remote work in the second year of the pandemic.

## Team Assessment

Communication was excellent between our group as we utilized our time during class to work through
the technical aspects early on and later on we used to practice the class presentation.
We also used email and Slack to communicate off hours on the weekend to tie up any loose ends 
regarding our project. One strength we used was we communicated early on what we felt 
comfortable doing so we all had a strength we can play towards to.

## Summary of Project 

After reviewing the data and visualizations we can conclude that remote work has little
to no impact on the productivity of workers, positively or negatively. We reached this
conclusion through the use of our unsupervised machine model.
Overall company success is also not impacted by remote work. With these insights in mind, 
if we had to make any recommendation to organizations it would be to offer flexible working
models to appeal to both sides of the workforce who want to be remote or want to be on-site.
This way you are able to attract the best talent needed for your projects.
